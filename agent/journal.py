"""The audit trail.

Every proposal, every veto and every fill lands here with the evidence that
produced it. This is what makes the desk explainable after the fact rather than
only at the moment of decision: a run's journal can reconstruct, for any trade,
the five contributions that summed to its score, the headlines behind the news
line, and every risk check the proposal passed on the way through.

Vetoes are kept, not discarded. A strategy's rejected proposals say as much
about it as its fills -- if the gate refused four fifths of what the desk
wanted to do, the equity curve belongs to the gate, not to the strategy.
